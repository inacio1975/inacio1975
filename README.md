# Hi everyone :wave:

I'm a web developer from Angola, who loves IT, and is currently working at [Sinfic](https://quatenus.com).
I mainly code in JavaScript, in 2021 I fell in love with Next.js, React, React Native and so many other modern web frameworks. I am always learning. Currently I'm also
working on a couple of projects, including my own
[Movimenta](https://movimenta.co.ao), which is a tool
that promises to be the leader of crowdfunding in Angola
